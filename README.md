## Labs

- **Lab 01**: You are working as a government cryptographer and are tasked with
writing a C program that implements a Caesar cipher to encrypt a string. The
encryption scheme should take any string of characters and shift the ASCII
value of alphabetical characters right by 3. Numbers, spaces, and special
characters should be left alone. For example, if the given string is “Hello all,
welcome to CPE325 Fall 2024!”, the output should be like the following:
Khoor doo, zhofrph wr FSH325 Idoo 2024!  
- **Lab 02**: Write a C program that will print the sizes and ranges of common data types char, short int, int, long int, long long int, unsigned char, unsigned short int, unsigned int, unsigned long int, unsigned long long int, float, and double. Your program’s output should be like the following:
